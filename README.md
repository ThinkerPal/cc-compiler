The [`CodeCollab`](https://codecollab.io) compiler used for running untrusted code. Currently supports 17 different languages.

## Prerequisites
1. Docker
2. Docker daemon running that doesn't require sudo access.

## Install
Using NPM:
```
$ npm install @portatolova/cc-compiler
```
This package comes with a dockerfile.
Navigate to the package and type the following command to install the docker image.
```
$ docker build -t 'cc-compiler' - < Dockerfile
```

## Usage

This package comes with a Compiler and an Attacher:
```Javascript
const Compiler = require("@portatolova/cc-compiler").Compiler;
const Attacher = require("@portatolova/cc-compiler").Attacher;
```

### Compiler
The compiler class is used to initialise and run the untrusted user code. This should be ran and executed before any attachment can take place.

```Javascript
// Initialises the compiler
let compiler = new Compiler(options);

compiler.exec();                    // Starts the compiler
compiler.push(data);                // Sends data into the running program
compiler.stop();                    // Stops the compiler
```

#### Options
  * `options.timeOut` Max time in seconds that program is allowed to run
  * `options.langNum` Index of language to Compile in (More info below)
  * `options.mainFile` The file in the compilation directory that will be ran during compilation
  * `options.pathToFiles` The compilation directory. (Where the files are stored) The path must be an absolute path and not a relative path.
  * `options.containerName` Name of the docker container created for compilation

`compiler.exec()` Starts compilation.

`compiler.push()` Pipes data into the program's STDIN stream.

`compiler.stop()` Stops compilation.

#### `options.langNum`:
Each language has an index or "langNum" used to identify it. Here are the langNums and their associated languages. (NOTE: There is no index 7)

    * 0 - Python 3.7
    * 1 - NodeJS
    * 2 - CoffeeScript
    * 3 - Typescript
    * 4 - C++
    * 5 - C
    * 6 - C#
    * 8 - Python 2.7
    * 9 - Bash Shell
    * 10 - Java
    * 11 - Swift
    * 12 - Golang
    * 13 - PHP
    * 14 - Ruby
    * 15 - Perl
    * 16 - Kotlin
    * 17 - Clojure
    * 18 - Scala

#### `options.pathToFiles`:
There is a specific structure that the specified directory needs to have. Here is the structure:

```
anyFolderName
    | - code
         | - fileOne.py
         | - fileTwo.py
         ...
```

Note that within the folder "anyFolderName" there is another folder named "code" that contains all the code to be run.

So when specifying a directory to `options.pathToFiles`, you should enter:
```Javascript
...
pathToFiles: "/path/to/directory/anyFolderName"
...
```

### Attacher
The attacher class is used to attach to an existing docker container.

```Javascript
// Initialises the compiler
let attacher = new Attacher(options);

attacher.attach();                  // Attaches to the compiler
attacher.push(data);                // Sends data into the running program
attacher.stop();                    // Stops the compiler
```

#### Options
  * `options.pathToFiles` The compilation directory. (Where the files are stored) The path must be an absolute path and not a relative path.
  * `options.containerName` Name of the docker container created for compilation

`attacher.attach()` Attach to an existing compiler.

`attacher.push()` Pipes data into the program's STDIN stream.

`attacher.stop()` Stops compilation.

### Events
Both the Compiler and Attach can emit 3 events.
* `error` emitted whenever the compiler encountered an error.
* `inc` emitted whenever the running program outputs anything to STDOUT or STDERR.
* `done` emitted when the program is finished running or it has timed out.

The Compiler also has an additional event
* `launched` emitted when the program has launched successfully.

## Example
This example runs code stored in /Users/carlvoller/test/code using Python 3.7. The compiler is listening for a "launched" event in which afterwards, it will attach the attacher to the compiler. The attacher then listens for "inc" and "done" events for program output and errors as well as for when compilation finishes. It then prints all output to the console.
```Javascript
const Compiler = require("../index").Compiler;
const Attacher = require("../index").Attacher;

// Initialise Compiler
let comp = new Compiler({
    timeOut: 60,
    langNum: 0,
    mainFile: "main.py",
    pathToFiles: "/Users/carlvoller/test",
    containerName: "Test1"
});

// Initialise Attacher
let attach = new Attacher({
    pathToFiles: "/Users/carlvoller/test",
    containerName: "Test1"
});

comp.exec(); // Start Compiler

// Listen for events
comp.on("launched", () => {
    console.log("Compiler has been launched.");

    // Attach the attacher
    attach.attach();
});

// Listen for data coming out from the program's STDOUT and STDERR streams
attach.on("inc", (inc) => {
    let output = inc.out,
        errors = inc.err;
    console.log(`"Program output: ${output}`);
    console.log(`"Program errored: ${errors}`);
});

// Listen for when the program finishes running OR timed out
attach.on("done", (done) => {
    let output   = done.out,
        errors   = done.err,
        time     = done.time,
        timedOut = done.timedOut;   // Did the program time out. (Took > options.timeOut time to compile)
    console.log(`"Program output: ${output}`);
    console.log(`"Program errored: ${errors}`);
    console.log(`"Program took ${time} to run.`);
    console.log(`"Program time out status: ${timedOut}`);
});

// Listen for any errors during initialisation
comp.on("error", (err) => console.log("An error occurred: ", err));
attach.on("error", (err) => console.log("An error occurred: ", err));
```
